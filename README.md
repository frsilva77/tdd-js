# Test Driven Development (TDD) in Javascript

This repo contains some examples of how to use TDD to make better code and give confidence to developers to do it.

I am using **Jest** to write all tests, **supertest** for tests in Node and **react-testing-library** in React.
All of them are great testing frameworks that makes easier to write tests with a focus on simplicity and with a point of view of users of your code.

Take a look into each folder that I will give examples and explain step-by-step in how to use those libraries and write test/code considering TDD.
